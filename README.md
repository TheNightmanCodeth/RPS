#  RPS - Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Source code for my first SwiftUI tutorial. RPS utilizes the MultipeerConnectivity framework to 
connect devices directly without the need for a backend or server. Once the tutorial is complete
I will link it here(:

In the meantime, feel free to check out [my dev.to post](https://dev.to/joe_diragi_3bb3b9c26bddca/the-horrors-of-multipeer-connectivity-and-swiftui-4-mkb) about how awful it was to figure out how to get Multipeer working with SwiftUI!!
